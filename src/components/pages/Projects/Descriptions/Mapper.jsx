      Over the course of four months, we broke down this project into four major
      milestones, each with its own specific objectives. <br />
      <br />
      The first milestone involved organizing vast amounts of data into
      structured formats, as well as utilizing and extending the OpenStreetMap
      API by developing useful functions that would be advantageous for
      subsequent phases. To achieve this, we created our database, using various
      STL structures such as maps, sets, vectors, and queues.
      <br />
      <br />
      The second milestone centered around the development of the map&apos;s
      frontend, which included streets, points of interest, subway mode, and
      bike mode, using a graphics library called EZGL, which depends on GTK 3
      and Cairo.
      <br />
      <br />
      For the third milestone, we implemented pathfinding between two
      intersection points on the map using Djikstra and A* algorithms. We also
      exhibited the pathfinding in our GTK Mapper.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the final milestone, we tackled the Travelling Courier Problem,
      utilizing various heuristics such as Greedy, Multi-Start, and
      Hill-Climbing. Our team&apos;s efforts paid off, as we finished 10th out
      of 91 teams, securing a spot in the top 10%.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our focus on the map was on eco-friendly GIS, with features that promoted
      public transit. Working on this Agile Software Development project was a
      remarkable experience that strengthened my skills in C++, Data Structures,
      and Algorithms.

      provide it upon request. The demo video is available through link below.{" "}
