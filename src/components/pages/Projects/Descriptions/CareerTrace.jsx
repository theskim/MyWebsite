      CareerTrace boasts a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user
      experience on both mobile and desktop devices. To enhance security and
      convenience, it offers Google Authentication for secure access. Behind the
      scenes, CareerTrace is powered by the classic MERN stack, which includes
      MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for backend server development, React
      and styled-components for a dynamic front-end, Node.js for server-side
      logic, and Google OAuth 2.0 for added security. CareerTrace is hosted on
      AWS, ensuring reliability and scalability for users. <br />
      <br />I primarily focused on connecting React and Express, handling
      incoming requests effectively. My work predominantly centered around
      enhancing React components, but I also made modifications to the Express
      backend to establish a seamless connection.
