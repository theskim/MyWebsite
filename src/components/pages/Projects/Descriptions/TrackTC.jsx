      Commuter students may not always be aware of potential delays or
      cancellations on the TTC due to various reasons. For some individuals, it
      can be difficult to regularly check media and the internet for updates,
      which can result in missing important closure information. Our team has
      personally experienced being late to exams or other important events due
      to unexpected commute interruptions. <br />
      <br />
      To help address this issue, we have developed a service that provides
      real-time and planned TTC delays, accessed through the TTC API. Simply
      enter your email and select your preferred buses and trains, and we will
      send you updates on their delay status every 12 hours.

      I primarily focused on the frontend of this project, including creating a
      Figma prototype and enhancing the website&apos;s responsive design. I also
      worked on implementing GET and POST requests using the Django-React stack
      and the Django REST Framework. Overall, it was a valuable learning
      experience and we are pleased to present this service at NewHacks 2022.

      Please be advised that in December 2022, we made updates to the backend
      and database for our software. The previous version, Version 1.0, utilized
      Django as the backend, while the current version, Version 2.0, now
      utilizes Express.js. <br />
