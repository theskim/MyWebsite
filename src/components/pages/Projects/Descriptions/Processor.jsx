      I was part of the development of a processor featuring a 16-bit
      architecture and 8 registers. The processor is capable of executing
      various instructions like mov, movt, add, sub, ldr, str, and b, among
      others. <br />
      <br />
      To debug the Verilog code, I employed an FSM timing diagram from ModelSim.
      I modified the ALU to implement instructions such as add, sub, and and.
      Tools like DESim were used to test the processor, which implements a
      word-matching game. A demonstration of this program is available through
      the demo link below. Code sharing is restricted due to academic integrity,
      but it can be provided upon request. <br />
